How I Made the Cubes
Starting from left to right, I simply followed the instructions for the first and second cubes. 
The rightmost cube simply was changing the textures and adding a different normal map. 
The center-top cube was created by following instructions. 
The final cube with the tiled texture was simply doing mod(vUv*2.0, 1.0).
